1. Projects:

PowerSet.py - Calculates and returns all possible subsets (the power set) by applying the backtracking approach.

RobbersAlgorithm.py - Wants to find the highest possible value within an array, with a rule, you can't add values from elements that are next to each other. 
        #The array traverses through an array, 
        #Checks if an element is next to the element you are in right now, and if so, skip it
        #Add the current value and the next-next value if it is optimal.
